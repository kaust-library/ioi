	echo '<hr><p>Want to do more with your ORCID ID? Bringing your publication history from other systems, such as <a href="http://europepmc.org/orcid/searchOrcid?wizard_source=import" target="_blank">Europe PMC</a>, <a href="http://orcid.scopusfeedback.com/" target="_blank">Scopus</a>, <a href="http://search.crossref.org/" target="_blank">CrossRef</a> and <a href="http://www.researcherid.com/" target="_blank">ResearcherID</a>, into your ORCID record is a good start. By including your ORCID ID in your submissions to publishers in the future your new publications can then also directly flow into your ORCID record.</p><p>Other systems can help bring together other pieces of your research. For example, <a href="http://www.uberresearch.com/orcid-wizard/" target="_blank">ÃœberResearch</a> provides a useful tool for connecting your grant funding history to your ORCID ID, and <a href="https://www.lens.org/support/help-resources/workspaces/recording-inventorship/" target="_blank">The Lens</a> allows you to record your inventor relationship to patents.</p>';
