Institutional ORCID Integration (IOI) provides a way for institutions to support the use of ORCID iDs by their researchers and students.

It is designed for use in conjunction with a DSpace repository (currently supporting DSpace versions 5 and 6). It expects the DSpace expanded-ORCID-support patch to already have been applied.

It interacts with ORCID using v.3 of the ORCID API. For full functionality ORCID membership and access to the ORCID member API is needed. It can also be used with the ORCID public API, but with limited functionality.
